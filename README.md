# Text analysis with ShinyR

ShinyApp for Text analysis (semantic)

I published this app together with an article on [The Data Journalist](https://thedatajournalist.com/2016/02/12/basic-income/).
It is online at https://thedatajournalist.shinyapps.io/SentimentApp/ and works perfectly fine (last access June 8, 2016).

The app analyzes a text, finds keywords, the topic and the sentiment. It uses the datumbox sentiment api.
